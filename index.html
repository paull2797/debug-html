        <h2>Instant Pot Lasagna Soup</h2>
        
        
        <!-- Problem 3 -->
        <p>
            You can make soups, ribs, hard boiled eggs, rice, broth, and many other delicious foods in the instant pot. My favorite style of cooking is making one-pot meals. You might dirty some knives, cutting boards, and mixing bowls during the prep. But you can clean those while the instant pot runs, and then only clean the instant pot liner after dinner. If you like lasagna, but you want a simpler version, try this recipe!

        Tips
        <!-- Problem 6 -->
        <ol>
        <li>Add some cooked/mashed sweet potato. It won't change the taste, but it'll add some good low-glycemic carbs.</li>
        <li>Make your own stock! It's much healthier/cheaper.</li>
        <li>Use pre-crushed garlic. It saves a lot of time on prep.</li>
        </ol>
